                    <ul>

                    <p>
                        Users may choose to share exported PDF files themselves (e.g., via email or messaging apps). This sharing is entirely user-initiated and outside the control of the developer.

                        The App uses industry-standard methods to ensure that all processing is handled securely on the device. Since no data is stored or transmitted, the risk of unauthorized access is minimized.
